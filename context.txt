Page: Photographer Page – AJ247 Studios (Anthony)

Purpose:
Create a FormSubmit.co HTML form that sends booking/inquiry data to jobangles4life@gmail.com.
This form is specifically for Anthony’s photography services.

Goal:
- Collect relevant inquiry details: name, email (with confirmation), shoot type, date, budget, and notes
- Use only HTML + vanilla JavaScript for validation
- Prevent form submission if email fields don’t match
- Use FormSubmit hidden fields to:
  - Set a subject line: “New Photography Inquiry – AJ247 Studios”
  - Disable CAPTCHA
  - Use the “box” email template
  - Redirect to a thank-you page: thank-you.html

Required Inputs:
- Name (text, required)
- Email (email, required)
- Confirm Email (email, required, must match above)
- Shoot Type (select): Weddings, Concerts, Sports, Portraits, Family, Other
- Event Date (date, optional but encouraged)
- Estimated Budget (text, optional)
- Notes / Message (textarea, optional)

Hidden Fields:
- _subject = "New Photography Inquiry – AJ247 Studios"
- _captcha = false
- _template = box
- _next = thank-you.html

Make the form semantically accessible with <label> elements and appropriate types.
Do not use external libraries — this should be raw HTML + optional inline JavaScript.
